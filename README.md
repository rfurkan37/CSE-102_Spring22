## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler or any C compiler
- Make utility (for projects with Makefiles)
- Text editor or IDE

### Compilation & Execution
Most projects include a `makefile` for easy compilation:

```bash
# Navigate to any project directory
cd homework-assignments/hw1

# Compile using make
make

# Run the executable
./main.out
```

For projects without makefiles:
```bash
# Compile manually
gcc -o program main.c

# Run
./program
```
